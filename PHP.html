        <h3><span>What is PHP Used For?</span></h3>

        <p>PHP is a general purpose programming language, so it can be used to do about anything. PHP is mainly used for three things:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Server-side scripting</li>
            <li>Command line scripting</li>
            <li>Writing desktop applications</li>
        </ol>

         <h3>General History and Evolution of PHP.</h3>

        <p>PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. 
            It was originally used to track visits to Lerdorf’s online resume, and he named it “Personal Home Page” tools (PHP tools).
            the first version was a simple set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in C, but Lerdorf eventually developed a 
            new model that had more implementation, like database interaction, and was used to develop simple dynamic web applications.
            In 1995, Lerdorf released the source code to the public.
        </p>

        <h4>FI</h4>

        <p>In September, Lerdorf actually dropped the PHP name for a bit, calling it FI (forms interpreter). This new 
            implementation added:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Perl-like variables</li>
            <li>Automatic interpretation of form variables</li>
            <li>HTML embedded syntax</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In October, Lerdorf released a complete rewrite of the language. The PHP name was brought back, 
            and this release was considered more of an advanced scripting interface. The new version purposefully 
            resembled C in structure, making it easier for developers to adopt.
        </p>

        <h4>PHP 2</h4>

        <p>The code got completely redone in April 1996, being now named PHP/FI, or PHP 2. This new generation really 
            began to change PHP from a set of tools to an outright programming language. PHP 2 included:
        </p>
      
        <ul>
            <li>Support for DBM</li>
            <li>mSQL</li>
            <li>Postgres95</li>
            <li>Cookies</li>
            <li>User-defined function support</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>PHP 3</h4>

        <p>
            In 1997, Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski began to work with Lerdorf to create what would become PHP 3.
            PHP 3 included:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mature interface for multiple databases</li>
            <li>Protocols</li>
            <li>API</li>
        </ul>

        <p>PHP 3 was beginning to be hosted on Windows 95, 98, and NT, and Macintosh operating systems.</p>

        <h4>PHP 4</h4>

        <p>PHP 4 was released in 1999, and included:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A rewritten core</li>
            <li>Support for more web servers</li>
            <li>HTTP sessions</li>
            <li>Output buffering</li>
            <li>More secure ways of handling user input</li>
            <li>Several new language constructs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>PHP 5</h4>

        <p>PHP 5 was released in July 2004, which was mainly driven by its Zend Engine 2.0.</p>
