        <h3><span>What is LISP Used For?</span></h3>

        <p>LISP was designed for easy manipulation of data strings, and is relatively simple. It is used as a general purpose
            scripting language, and it is also used for artificial intelligence research. 
        </p>

        <h3>General History and Evolution of LISP.</h3>

        <p>LISP was created in 1959 by by John McCarthy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The first implementation of 
            Lisp was used on an IBM 704 using punched cards.

        <h4>LISP in the 1960s and 70s</h4>

        <p>The popularity of LISP grew throughout the 1960s and was used by researchers and developers for artificial intelligence 
            research. In the 1970s, a new dialect of LISP called Scheme was created, which was meant to be a more simple version of 
            LISP used to teach computer science courses.
        </p>
        
        

        <h4>LISP From the 1990s Onward</h4>

        <p>LISPâ€™s popularity fell throughout the 90s, but grew in the 2000s when entrepreneur Paul Graham wrote an 
            essay about the advantages of LISP.
